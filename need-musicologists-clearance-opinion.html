      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What Is a Music Similarity Risk Opinion?</h2>
      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">A music similarity risk opinion is a formal, written analysis by a forensic musicologist. It assesses whether your work is likely to be deemed substantially similar to existing music, reducing your exposure to infringement claims. Unlike automated tools or informal opinions, this is a court-tested, defensible report.</p>
