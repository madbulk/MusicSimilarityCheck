  <h1>Letter of Engagement</h1>

  <p><strong>Dear Celeste Butera,</strong></p>

  <p>I’m very pleased that you contacted me in connection with providing services as an expert in connection with the question of whether a musical composition(s) may infringe or be infringed upon by one or more other compositions you have identified. This letter will confirm our agreement.</p>

  <p>I will provide expert services to you, and the scope, the manner of calculating, billing, and collecting fees, and other aspects of my services are mutually agreed to be as follows:</p>

  <h2>1. Services to Be Provided</h2>
  <p>I will undertake to provide expert services in connection with the above analysis only. Initially, this will consist of meeting with you and your colleagues by email, phone, Skype, or Zoom, discussion of the issues, review of materials, research as required, written analysis and/or a report if requested, formulation of an opinion, and testimony at one or more depositions, arbitration(s), and/or trial, if required. In all aspects, upon your request, I will work closely with you in providing services. Any information you provide to me in the course of this engagement is confidential and will be held in confidence for a period of five years from the date first above written.</p>

  <p>On the issue of copyright infringement, courts apply a two-step test: access of the alleged infringer to the claimed infringed material, and similarity of the two pieces. In providing services, I can only address the question of musical similarity. Access is a question of fact that would be determined at a hearing or trial.</p>

  <p>I agree to perform all services under this Agreement to the best of my ability, in a professional, competent, and timely manner, in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, regulations, licensing requirements, and business codes. You agree and acknowledge that my analysis, report, and any other work product represents my subjective, though considered, analysis, opinion, and conclusion, and carries with it no guarantee, indemnity, or endorsement of any kind, and that I make no promise or guarantee of results that may follow from its use. The services I provide are analytical, not legal. For legal services in any potential infringement matter, a lawyer with experience in the field should be engaged.</p>

  <h2>2. Determination of Fees for Service</h2>
  <p><strong>A.</strong> Fees for the services I will provide may be project based, for contained services such as “clearances,” and priced per project; or hourly based, for ongoing engagements and change orders to project scope, based on two hourly rates. In connection with all hourly services except depositions and testimony, the rate is $350 per hour. In connection with depositions and/or testimony, the rate is $495 per hour with a minimum charge of four hours per day if testimony is given in the San Francisco Bay Area, and eight hours per day if it is out of town. Travel time in connection with services outside the Bay Area is billed in half-day increments portal to portal. Rush orders for services, typically less than 48 hours notice, will incur a rate increase of double the normal rates. I will provide estimates of the fees for various services upon your request.</p>

  <p><strong>B.</strong> Upon commencement of this engagement, I request a retainer payment of $1000 which will be treated as earned upon payment; and will be credited against initial time charges until it is exhausted.</p>

  <h2>3. Disbursements and Expenses</h2>
  <p>I may incur various expenses in providing services. You agree to pay all such expenses and to reimburse me for all out-of-pocket expenses that I pay on your behalf. Whenever possible, I will forward bills for any expenses incurred on your behalf directly to you and you agree to make prompt, direct payment to the originator of these bills. Expenses that may be incurred include, but are not necessarily limited to, charges for courier and messenger services, copying charges, and airfare, ground transportation, lodging and per diem for services outside the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

  <h2>4. Statements</h2>
  <p>I will bill you for all services and reimbursable disbursements on a monthly basis. All amounts billed are due upon receipt and may be paid by check drawn on a United States bank. If the account is overdue by more than 30 days, I reserve the right to terminate all further services upon notice to you to that effect, or suspend the provision of any further services until your account balance is paid.</p>

  <h2>5. Scope of Services</h2>
  <p>I am not responsible for matters for which my services or advice have not been specifically requested and confirmed by me in writing. I will have no duty to update you about any matter in which I may have previously advised you.</p>

  <h2>6. Other Engagements</h2>
  <p>I reserve the right to provide similar services to existing or new clients in any matter that is not substantially related to my services on this matter, even if the interests of such clients are substantially similar to yours.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Right to Terminate Services</h2>
  <p>You may terminate my services with or without cause by notifying me in writing. Upon receipt of your written notice, I will stop work immediately and waive any rights to further compensation, except for fees and expenses incurred before termination.</p>

  <h2>8. Work Papers, Etc.</h2>
  <p>All work papers and other materials that I create during the providing of services hereunder will be your property and upon your written request, will be turned over to you upon the conclusion of services.</p>

  <h2>9. Waiver of Warranties</h2>
  <p>My entitlement to the fees and reimbursements for disbursements described above is not contingent upon the final outcome of the matter. I cannot and do not warrant or predict the outcome of any matter.</p>

  <h2>10. My Right to Terminate Services</h2>
  <p>I reserve the right to terminate my services if you breach this agreement, fail to cooperate, or if a conflict of interest or ethical concern arises. In that case, you agree to compensate me for all services rendered and expenses incurred up to the point of termination.</p>

  <h2>11. Communications Policies</h2>
  <p>I may communicate using email, phone, or internet-based platforms. Some methods are less secure than others. If you object to any method, you must notify me in writing.</p>

  <h2>12. Commencement of Services</h2>
  <p>Services begin when I receive a signed copy of this agreement along with the retainer.</p>

  <h2>13. Entire Agreement</h2>
  <p>This document constitutes the entire agreement and may not be modified except in writing by both parties.</p>

  <h2>14. Binding Effect</h2>
  <p>This agreement is binding on both parties and their successors and assigns.</p>

  <h2>15. Assignment</h2>
  <p>This agreement may not be assigned by either party without written consent.</p>

  <h2>16. Controlling Law</h2>
  <p>This agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California.</p>

  <p>If the foregoing terms are acceptable, please indicate your agreement during the form submission process. I look forward to working with you.</p>
