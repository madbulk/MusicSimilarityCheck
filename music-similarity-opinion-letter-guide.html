<h2 id="what-is" class="text-xl font-medium">1. What Is a Music Similarity Opinion?</h2>
<!-- Section 1 TL;DR -->
<p class="font-semibold leading-relaxed">
  A music similarity opinion is a short, positive letter from an independent musicologist that confirms your track is unlikely to infringe existing works.
</p>
<p class="leading-relaxed">
  A <strong>music similarity opinion</strong> (sometimes called a
  <em>music similarity clearance</em> or <em>musicologist opinion letter</em>)
  is the final, written outcome of a two-step service:
</p>

<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 leading-relaxed">
  <li><strong>Confidential analysis&nbsp;</strong>—an independent forensic
      musicologist reviews your work, compares it to reference songs, and
      privately flags any passages that invite copyright risk, along with
      practical suggestions for revision.</li>
  <li><strong>Positive clearance letter&nbsp;</strong>—once the track clears
      that threshold (most require only minor tweaks),
      you receive a written opinion confirming the view that the music is unlikely
      to infringe any existing works.</li>
</ol>

<p class="leading-relaxed">
  The written letter itself is always affirmative; any sensitive analysis subject to misunderstanding is expressed confidentially.
</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-medium mt-6">What the Letter Contains</h3>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 leading-relaxed">
  <li><strong>Project overview</strong> – a concise description of the cleared track</li>
  <li><strong>Method summary</strong> – reference works considered and elements examined</li>
  <li><strong>Signed clearance statement</strong> – professional opinion that the track is not substantially similar to protected works and that accusations to the contrary are likely attributable to misobservations.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sample-vs-similarity" class="text-lg font-medium mt-6">
  Music Similarity Opinion vs. Sample Clearance
</h3>
<p class="leading-relaxed">
  “Sample” is often used interchangeably or confused with “copying” or “plagiarism,”
  but they are distinct concepts. <strong>Sample clearance</strong> focuses on the
  <em>sound recording</em> and whether you inserted actual audio from another work.
  A music similarity opinion focuses on the <em>composition and musical expression</em>
  whether or not audio sampling occurred.
</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-medium mt-6">When Do Clients Request One?</h3>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 leading-relaxed">
  <li><strong>Pre-release</strong>: before a single or album goes public</li>
  <li><strong>Pre-use in media</strong>: prior to placing music in advertising, film, or game projects</li>
  <li><strong>Sound-alike sanity check</strong>: when a track “feels close. It may even have been intentionally composed and produced to share qualities with a known song. Done well, this can be perfectly fine.</li>
</ol>

<p class="leading-relaxed">
  A rapid review either confirms the track is "clear" or highlights tweaks you can
  make before publishing. The resulting letter greatly reduces the risk associated with similarity
  claims and demonstrates professional due diligence to labels, agencies, and distributors.
</p>

<blockquote class="leading-relaxed italic border-l-4 pl-3 mt-4">
  <strong>In short:</strong> the MusicSimilarityCheck service gives you candid,
  confidential feedback first, then a formal clearance letter once your music is ready for release.
</blockquote>

<!-- SECTION: 2 · When Do You Need a Music Similarity Opinion? -->
<h2 id="when-needed" class="text-xl font-medium">2. When Do You Need a Music Similarity Opinion?</h2>
<!-- Section 2 TL;DR -->
<p class="font-semibold leading-relaxed">
  Order an opinion once the mix is locked but before ads, film-game placements, or distribution, so any risky passage can be tweaked while schedules are still flexible.
</p>
      
<!-- ——— Media-placement focus ——— -->
<p class="leading-relaxed">
  For <strong>agencies, brands, and in-house media teams</strong>, even a
  15-second cue can attract lawsuits once it airs under a household name.
  Requesting a similarity opinion before a track ships to broadcast, social,
  or game platforms lets us flag and fix risky passages while edits are quick and
  budgets are still fluid.
</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 leading-relaxed">
  <li><strong>Advertising, film, broadcast or game use</strong> – clearance letter is now a standard deliverable for many clients.</li>
  <li><strong>Sound-alike briefs</strong> – confirm that a requested “in-the-style-of” track is not too close to its reference.</li>
  <li><strong>Corporate campaigns</strong> – large nonprofits and public companies rightly want proof of due diligence before rollout.</li>
</ul>

<!-- ——— Artist / label focus ——— -->
<p class="leading-relaxed mt-6">
  <strong>Recording artists and labels</strong> face a different pinch point:
  Music often reaches mastering, metadata delivery, or file hand-off to the distributor before anyone stops to ask
  “Is this too similar to...?”  A well-timed opinion prevents last-minute remix costs,
  takedown threats, and fan backlash.
</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 leading-relaxed">
 <li><strong>Pre-release</strong>: order the review once the mix is locked but before mastering and final file delivery to your distributor or label.</li>
   <li><strong>Early A&amp;R feedback</strong> – if a collaborator says the hook reminds them of a hit, verify it now rather than after release.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Timing rationale -->
<h3 class="text-lg font-medium mt-6">Why timing matters</h3>
<p class="leading-relaxed">
  Engaging the musicologist while stems are open avoids rush fees and schedule slips.
  If revisions are needed, you can address them before the track is heard by millions
  of listeners,including would-be plaintiffs looking for a quick settlement.
</p>

<blockquote class="leading-relaxed italic border-l-4 pl-3 mt-4">
  In practice, the safest moment is after creative sign-off on the mix
  but before the asset leaves your direct control, whether that is the ad-agency delivery
  date or the DSP upload window.

    <h3 class="font-medium">Scope and payment link</h3>

    <h3 class="font-medium">Confidential forensic review</h3>
    <p class="mt-1">
      The music is analysed for melody, harmony, rhythm, lyrics, and other
      protectable elements. If we find concerning risk, we share those details
      privately, suggest specific fixes, set up a call with composers, and complete the project.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3 class="font-medium">Revision window</h3>
    <p class="mt-1">
      Most projects clear on the first pass, but you can submit up to two quick

    <h3 class="font-medium">Positive clearance letter delivered</h3>
    <p class="mt-1">
      Once the track meets the threshold, you receive a signed PDF opinion

<!-- TL;DR sentence -->
<p class="font-semibold leading-relaxed">
  Short answers to the questions we hear most often about music similarity clearance.
</p>

<dl class="space-y-4 leading-relaxed">

  <dt class="font-medium">Does the opinion letter guarantee I will not be sued?</dt>
  <dd>
    No document can prevent someone from filing a claim, but an expert similarity
    opinion demonstrates good-faith review and discourages all-too-common weak, delusional, or
    opportunistic cases.
  </dd>

  <dt class="font-medium">How fast will I receive the letter?</dt>
  <dd>
    Standard service is usually two to three business days after payment.
    Rush service is one day, and by special request and subject to queue availability, possibly same day.
  </dd>

  <dt class="font-medium">What audio format should I send?</dt>
  <dd>
    A high-quality MP3 or WAV at 44.1&nbsp;kHz is ideal for easy submission.
    If you have stems or multiple references, we'll make arrangements with you to include them as separate files.
  </dd>

  <dt class="font-medium">What if you find a high-risk passage or concerning similarity?</dt>
  <dd>
    We call you privately, explain the concern in both musical and plain terms, and suggest practical fixes.
    One quick follow-up check of the revised mix is included at no extra cost.
  </dd>

  <dt class="font-medium">Can the letter be addressed to my client or legal team?</dt>
  <dd>
    Yes, of course. Note the addressee during checkout, and we will create the letter accordingly.
  </dd>

  <dt class="font-medium">When might pricing change?</dt>
  <dd>
    It's rare, but factors such as extra reference tracks, long, multi-movement, or complex works, or requests
    for formal notation can add hourly review time. Those rare cases are covered
    by the hourly terms in the <a href="/terms.html" class="link">Letter of Engagement</a>.
