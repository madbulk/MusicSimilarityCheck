<h2 id="what-is" class="text-xl font-medium">1. What Is a Music Similarity Opinion?</h2>

<p class="leading-relaxed">
  A <strong>music similarity opinion</strong> (sometimes called a
  <em>music similarity clearance</em> or <em>musicologist opinion letter</em>)
  is the final, written outcome of a two-step service:
</p>

<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 leading-relaxed">
  <li><strong>Confidential analysis&nbsp;</strong>—an independent forensic
      musicologist reviews your work, compares it to reference songs, and
      privately flags any passages that invite copyright risk, along with
      practical suggestions for revision.</li>
  <li><strong>Positive clearance letter&nbsp;</strong>—once the track clears
      that threshold (most require only minor tweaks),
      you receive a written opinion confirming the view that the music is unlikely
      to infringe any existing works.</li>
</ol>

<p class="leading-relaxed">
  The written letter itself is always affirmative; any sensitive analysis subject to misunderstanding is expressed confidentially.
</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-medium mt-6">What the Letter Contains</h3>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 leading-relaxed">
  <li><strong>Project overview</strong> – a concise description of the cleared track</li>
  <li><strong>Method summary</strong> – reference works considered and elements examined</li>
  <li><strong>Signed clearance statement</strong> – professional opinion that the track is not substantially similar to protected works and that accusations to the contrary are likely attributable to misobservations.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sample-vs-similarity" class="text-lg font-medium mt-6">
  Music Similarity Opinion vs. Sample Clearance
</h3>
<p class="leading-relaxed">
  “Sample” is often used interchangeably or confused with “copying” or “plagiarism,”
  but they are distinct concepts. <strong>Sample clearance</strong> focuses on the
  <em>sound recording</em> and whether you inserted actual audio from another work.
  A music similarity opinion focuses on the <em>composition and musical expression</em>
  whether or not audio sampling occurred.
</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-medium mt-6">When Do Clients Request One?</h3>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1 leading-relaxed">
  <li><strong>Pre-release</strong>: before a single or album goes public</li>
  <li><strong>Pre-use in media</strong>: prior to placing music in advertising, film, or game projects</li>
  <li><strong>Sound-alike sanity check</strong>: when a track “feels close. It may even have been intentionally composed and produced to share qualities with a known song. Done well, this can be perfectly fine.</li>
</ol>

<p class="leading-relaxed">
  A rapid review either confirms the track is "clear" or highlights tweaks you can
  make before publishing. The resulting letter greatly reduces the risk associated with similarity
  claims and demonstrates professional due diligence to labels, agencies, and distributors.
</p>

<blockquote class="leading-relaxed italic border-l-4 pl-3 mt-4">
  <strong>In short:</strong> the MusicSimilarityCheck service gives you candid,
  confidential feedback first, then a formal clearance letter once your music is ready for release.
</blockquote>
</p>

      <!-- SECTION: 2 · When Do You Need a Music Similarity Opinion? -->
<h2 id="when-needed" class="text-xl font-medium">2. When Do You Need a Music Similarity Opinion?</h2>

<p class="leading-relaxed">
  Most creators wait until the music is mixed and almost on its way to the distributor.
  That is nearly too late.  A well-timed opinion lets you fix any risky passage before
  mastering, metadata delivery, or marketing spend.
</p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-medium mt-4">Common trigger points</h3>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 leading-relaxed">
  <li><strong>Label or independent release</strong>: You are about to upload to DSPs or press vinyl.</li>
  <li><strong>Advertising, film, or game use</strong>: The agency or production house needs written clearance.</li>
  <li><strong>Sound-alike brief</strong>: The track was intentionally shaped to evoke a known song and you need a “too close?” check.</li>
  <li><strong>Early A&amp;R feedback</strong>: Someone on the team says, “This reminds me of …” and you want peace of mind.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-lg font-medium mt-4">Why earlier is better</h3>
<p class="leading-relaxed">
  An opinion delivered during pre-production or mix-review costs the same but avoids
  rush fees, remix expenses, and delayed launch dates.  If tweaks are needed, you can
  address them while stems are still open and collaborators are still engaged.
</p>

<blockquote class="leading-relaxed italic border-l-4 pl-3 mt-4">
  Plan on ordering the opinion once the song is mixed enough to represent its melody
  and harmony accurately, but before mastering and marketing go live.
