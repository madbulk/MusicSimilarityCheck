        Human Musicologist vs AI Plagiarism Checker: Why Legal Clearance Still Needs Expert Ears

    <!-- Intro -->
    <section>
      <p>
        Type “<em>song plagiarism checker</em>” into Google and you’ll see AI tools that promise to
        scan millions of tracks in seconds. Handy? Sure. Legally bullet-proof? Not even close.
        Below are five reasons ad agencies, labels, and serious indie creators still rely on a
        human musicologist’s opinion letter when real money—and litigation risk—are on the line.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 1. What AI checkers actually do -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium">1. What AI Checkers Really Do</h2>
      <p>
        Most AI plagiarism apps convert audio into melody and rhythm vectors, then compute
        cosine similarity across a reference database. Useful for spotting broad resemblance, but
        they’re oblivious to <strong>protectable expression</strong>—the legal threshold that matters in
        court. A two-bar match of a common I–V–vi–IV progression might trigger a red alert in an AI
        dashboard but mean <em>nothing</em> to a judge or jury.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Legal doctrine -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium">2. Courts Care About Expression, Not Statistics</h2>
      <p>
        Copyright infringement hinges on <em>substantial similarity</em> in protectable elements.
        That’s a qualitative judgment. Expert testimony walks the finder of fact through melody,
        harmony, rhythm, lyrics, orchestration, and historical context. A black-box heat-map can’t
        be cross-examined, and judges routinely exclude such evidence under the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_standard" class="link" target="_blank">Daubert standard</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Admissibility -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium">3. Admissibility &amp; Daubert Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Even if you print the AI report, opposing counsel can move to strike it. Without a qualified
        expert to explain methodology and margin of error, an algorithm’s output is hearsay.
        MusicSimilarityCheck letters are signed by an expert with courtroom experience—<em>and</em>
        include the analytical narrative courts accept.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. False positives/negatives -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium">4. False Positives &amp; Negatives Cost Real Money</h2>
      <p>
        AI over-flags ubiquitous patterns (♪ 1-2 | 3-3-2 is <em>tresillo</em> in half of pop music).
        Conversely, it can miss subtle melodic inversion or harmonic pacing that triggers
        litigation—ask any publisher sued over a three-note motif. A human review filters false
        alarms and spots nuanced risk before it becomes a six-figure settlement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Hybrid future -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium">5. The Hybrid Future Is Assistive—Not Autonomous</h2>
      <p>
        We’re bullish on AI <em>assisting</em> musicologists: speeding up prior-art searches, visualizing
        contour overlap, suggesting listening targets. But until AI can parse legal doctrine,
        intent, and musical context, a standalone “plagiarism score” won’t satisfy gatekeepers—or
        courts. Think of AI as the X-ray; the expert is still the radiologist.
